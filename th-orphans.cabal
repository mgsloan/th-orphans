synopsis:           Orphan instances for TH datatypes
description:        Orphan instances for TH datatypes.  In particular, instances
                    for Ord and Lift, as well as a few missing Show / Eq.  These
                    instances used to live in haskell-src-meta, and that's where
                    the version number started.
